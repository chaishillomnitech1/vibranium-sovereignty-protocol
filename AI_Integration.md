# Evo-Memory Links Expansion

In our ongoing efforts to refine the functionality of Evo-Memory within the Vibranium Sovereignty Protocol, we are implementing dynamic auction-scored SALE processes. This will ensure that resources are prioritized and allocated based on real-time needs, enhancing the efficiency of operations.

## Dynamic Auction-Scored SALE Processes

- **Real-time Scoring:** Utilizing a scoring algorithm that dynamically adjusts according to task requirements and resource availability.
- **Bid Optimization:** Agents can place bids based on their current capabilities and historical performance metrics, allowing for an adaptable resource acquisition strategy.

## Peer-Task Optimization for Adaptable Hierarchies

We are also introducing peer-task optimization features that allow for more fluid restructuring of agent hierarchies based on task demands. This includes:
- **Task Redistribution:** Enabling agents to redistribute tasks amongst themselves dynamically, ensuring that tasks are handled by the most capable agents.
- **Performance Metrics:** Agents utilize performance data to optimize their task assignments continually, fostering an environment of adaptability and efficiency.

## Adaptive Routing Mechanics and Strategy Bank Evolution

Lastly, to enhance agent coordination and improve task efficiency, we are integrating adaptive routing mechanics with the evolution of our strategy bank.
- **Routing Algorithms:** Enhanced algorithms that adapt based on current task assignments, ensuring that the most efficient routing paths are utilized.
- **Strategy Bank Updates:** Continuous evolution of strategies based on new insights and completed tasks, allowing for a more responsive coordination system amongst agents.
